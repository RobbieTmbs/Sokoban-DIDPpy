; Microban (155 puzzles, revised April, 2000) This is a good set for beginners and
; children. Most of the puzzles are small and illustrate a particular concept.
; More experienced players should also find them interesting, since they are as
; different from each other as I could make them given their size. Sokoholics
; could perhaps time themselves on completing the whole set. This set also
; contains puzzles which I thought were interesting but too easy to include in my
; regular sets.

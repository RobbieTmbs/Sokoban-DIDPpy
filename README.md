Third year dissertation project repo; modelling and solving the 2D puzzle game Sokoban using the DIDP framework for python

basic.py - Basic non-domain-specific model for Sokoban
updated.py - Updated model with domain-specific techniques like deadlock detection

How to run:
- Install didppy and matplotlib for some funky graphs
- Run either basic.py or updated.py for the basic or updated (deadlock detection) model
- Change test set by updating the folder_path to one of the three available: Test, xSokoban, Microban
